# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends for Louise
## Introduction
Using a data from a popular crowdfunding website containing roughly 4,000 kickstaters, I have analyzed the data to determine the parameters of a successful kickstarter campaign, which should provide you with useful information for planning your own kickstater for your play, <i>Fever</i>.
## Data
Data was collected from a popular crowdfunding website, and N = 4113.
## Methods
First, the average donation and percent funded for each campaign was calculated, which can be found on the Kickstarter sheet in rows Q and P, respectively. Next, I filtered for successful theater campaigns in the U.S (n = 525).
## Analysis
## Results
## Conclusion
Because most successful kickstarters in the plays and musicals category pledge for less than $2,000 in the months from May-July, I suggest you start a kickstarter, asking for $2,000 in the middle of the year.
