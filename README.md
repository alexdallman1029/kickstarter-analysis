# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends for Louise
## Introduction
Using a data from a popular crowdfunding website containing roughly 4,000 kickstaters, I have analyzed the data to determine the parameters of a successful kickstarter campaign, which should provide you with useful information for planning your own kickstater for your play, <i>Fever</i>.
## Data
Data was collected from a popular crowdfunding website, and N = 4113.
## Methods and Analysis
First, the average donation and percent funded for each campaign was calculated, which can be found on the Kickstarter sheet in rows Q and P, respectively. Next, I found the outcomes for campaigns organized by parent categories (see Figure 1), subcategories (see Figure 2), and launch date (see Figure 3) for campaigns within the U.S. Because the five plays she saw at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe were of interest, the average donations and outcomes of these plays were analyzed. To finalize, statistical analysis was conducted. The mean, median, standard deviation, upper and lower quartiles, and the IQR were calculated for the pledged and goal amounts for successful and failed campaigns. See Figure 4.
## Results
Results for each outcome based on parent categories, subcategories, and launch date can be seen the appendix (Figures 1, 2, and 3.) The parent category with the highest count of successful campaigns was theater. The subcategory with the highest count of successful campaigns was plays. The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May, and the months of January, June, July, and October all had approximately the same number of failed campaigns launched. Based on the descriptive statistics, the mean of each distribution was in the 3rd quartile. The data follow similar distributions in each subset. The standard deviations are larger than the mean, and large values are impacting the distributions. In each distribution except the failed kickstarters, the standard deviations are about twice the IQR. Because
## Conclusion
Theaters, and specifically plays, have a high success rate for kickstarters. Because most successful kickstarters in the plays and musicals category pledge for less than $2,000 in the months from May-July, I suggest you start a kickstarter, asking for $2,000, starting in May. Because most campaigns receive 110% of their funding goals in the plays subcatergory, you can expect to receive more than the pledge of $2,000. You can then start additional campaigns within the months of May-June if more funding is needed.
